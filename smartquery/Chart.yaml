description: A smartQuery Helm chart for Kubernetes

# This chart is defined as an 'application' chart, meaning it contains a collection of templates
# that can be packaged and deployed. This chart specifically handles the deployment of the
# smartQuery Module application of searchhub.

# The smartQuery module is a key component of searchhub, responsible for mapping similar queries
# (e.g., “skate board”, “skateboarding”, “skateboards”, “skateboard”, “scate burd”) to a single
# optimized query known as the MasterQuery. It connects to the searchHub API to obtain necessary
# data and to send back statistics and performance metrics related to the query mapping process.
